As I can feel my fourth MVP couldn't be launched, puzzled towards ever lasting learning of start up building. Started reading the d.school book "This is Prototype". Now I realized that I was walking on Engineer's path.  Build (a thorough product - like an engineering marvel) and look for what to do ?
