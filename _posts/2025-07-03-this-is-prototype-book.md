# "This is a PROTOTYPE" a must read book from d.school

_why I didnt read this book, before I start building my MVP(s)_

---

## Overview

&nbsp; &nbsp; When you are a Maker, Builder and Founder(or trying to be one), you must played around terms IDEA, CONCEPT, POC[^1], PROTOTYPE , MVP[^2] and PRODUCT. But have you ever wondered how these are related and differ. Should you really bother to differentiate these. Actually you should, at least after my experience. After successful delivery of multiple MVPs on production grade and not sure what to do next, I finally discovered some other component called USERS who eventually become CUSTOMER. Then landed on "Build what customer want ?" eventually you should be "Talking to User", "what to ask" , "how to ask" etc.

**"PROTOTYPE"** is heavily overloaded term, [SCOTT WITTHOFT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/switthoft/) disects through numerous dimensions from this life saver ["This is a PROTOTYPE"](https://dschool.stanford.edu/shop/this-is-a-prototype) .

#### PROTOTYPE:

What is it as a nown,as a verb ? Stakeholders involved in proto typing ? Where will you do ? What do you need to do ? How to do ? Who can do it ? What mindset is needed ? How long can you do ? How many would you do ? How do you test ? What would you observe ? What is the output ? What is the outcome ?

With all these enquiries it addresses many questions and frustrations, and helps to germinate a seed of an idea and grow it to a Tree. This must read from d.school clarifies,

- what is a prototype and what is not a prototype .
- What do you need to build one ?
- How do you build one ?
- How do you test ?
- What do you get from this exercise.

If I would have realized the concepts in this book earlier, I would have reached product markt fit. Instead of wandering around

1. Build the prototype (with efficient code and best UI deployed on cutting edge CI/CD )
2. Sales : "How to learn to sell in 12 hours ?"
3. Digital Marketing : Learn for digital marketing

&nbsp;&nbsp; SCOTT has done phenomenal job of break the mindset and attitude of a maker, builder or craftsman and rebuild into A Prototyper. A prototyper is crazy, experimental, demanding mom to her child, shameless to strip off his idea and expose to the world for testament, has no attachment to his idea and treats his conception as a wet clay.

## Why do you need a prototype ? instead of talk to an user?

- Users may not know what they want and how they want ? (Eg: iPhone)
- A solution of an eco-system could be harder to be understood by user and convinced to accept ( Eg: UBER , NETFLIX )
- But they can visualize from a mock up.
- They can understand and respond for an experience.

## What is a prototype ?

&nbsp; &nbsp; A prototype is to learn, to explore and discover required features of a product. When you have assimilated all these requirements you have all the incredients to build the core product. It is shocking to know that while prototyping you should walk in opposite direction compare to building a PRODUCT.

| Prototyping                                                             | Product building                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Prototyper                                                              | Craftsman                           |
| explore                                                                 | build                               |
| Careless                                                                | Careful                             |
| Doubts                                                                  | Walks with confident                |
| Not shy to build with what is available.                                | Builds with best material available |
| Sometimes deliberately choses coarser tool for LOW Resolution prototype | Perfection and best is the goal     |
| Fast                                                                    | Steady                              |
| Will break the work at end                                              | Iterates at the end                 |
| Artistic and Right brained.                                             | Logical and Left brained            |

But why should you define **what is a PROTOTYPE**, while I am building my MVPs, kept oscilating on resolution and tool usage ( LOW vs High), I was kept adviced for lower resolution which is against my instict for perfection. Now I realize that those advices are for "Prototyping". As engineers are hardwired to write efficient, maintainable, reliable ,scalable, testable and deployable code, mostly they end up higher resolution path. But the priority even during MVP should be on iterations.

Defining objectives of a prototype helps you stay withing the boundaries of available resources, time and get tested on the right group, kept observed for the feedback.

Optimum approach would be prototypes are built with LOW resolution and scrapable but still gives closer to real product experience.

## What do I need ?

Whether you use tools to embody your idea or the tools you have creates or influences an idea. In my experience

## What am I doing ?

How to keep yourself within the boundaries of

- Low Resolution
- Coarser Tool
- Easy materials

## Of course you should build what customer want

&nbsp;&nbsp; But how do you know what customer wants ?

### iPhone

imagine you are in 2006 and envisioning to build an iPhone.

- Would you talk with an user ? no
- Would you prototype ? no.
- What should you do ? Just build the iPhone.

### TESLA

imagine you are in 2004 and envisioning to build Tesla model 3.

- Would you observe user ? Yes
  Since you are not building the first electric car. Because Nissan successfully selling its NISSAN LEAF. So

| How                         | Answer       |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| By talking with customer ?  | No           |
| By observing the customer ? | Sometimes    |
| By imagination ?            | Probably yes |

### Where Prototype is appropriate ?

### Where would you talk to user ?

### where would you observe user ?

### where would you train an user ?

&nbsp; &nbsp; When I built my first MVP spent 95% of my time only on technical aspects and anxious when I was thinking about users or validating idea.

_Improvements to work on_

- How can you understand potential of a seed by just looking it ?
- second improvement
  - sub improvement
