# "This is a PROTOTYPE" a must read book from d.school
_why I didnt read this book, before I start building my MVP(s)_

---

&nbsp; &nbsp; When you are a Maker, Builder and Founder(or trying to be one), you must played around terms IDEA, CONCEPT, POC[^1], PROTOTYPE and MVP[^2]. But have you ever wondered how these are related and how do they differ each other. Should you really bother to differentiate these. Actually you should, at least after my experience.  After successful completion of multiple MVPs and not sure what to do next, I finally discovered some other component called USERS who eventually become CUSTOMER, then landed on "Build what customer want ?" "Talking to User", , what to ask , how to ask etc. But this amazing seed ["This is a PROTOTYPE"](https://dschool.stanford.edu/shop/this-is-a-prototype) from d.school explained many questions and frustrations that I had. 

Through this book the author [SCOTT WITTHOFT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/switthoft/) clarifies 
  - what is a prototype  and what is not a prototype .
  - What do you need to build one ?
  - How do you build one ?
  - How do you test ?
  - What do you get from this exercise.

## What is a prototype ?
&nbsp; &nbsp; A prototype is to learn, to explore and discover required features of a product. When you have assimilated all these requirements you have all the incredients to build the core product. It is shocking to know that prototyping is to walk in opposite direction compare to  building a PRODUCT.

| Prototyper                             | Craftsman            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| explore                                | build                |
| Doubts                                 | Walks with confident |
| No shy to build with what is available | Perfection is goal   |
| Fast                                   | Steady               |
| Breaks at the end                      | Iterates at the end  |
|                                        |

&nbsp; &nbsp; When I built my first MVP spent 95% of my time only on technical aspects and anxious when I was thinking about users or validating idea.
