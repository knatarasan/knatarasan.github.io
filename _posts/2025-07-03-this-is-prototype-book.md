# "This is a PROTOTYPE" a must read book from d.school
_why I didnt read this book, before I start building my MVP(s)_

---

&nbsp; &nbsp; When you are a Maker, Builder and Founder(or trying to be one), you must played around terms IDEA, CONCEPT, POC[^1], PROTOTYPE and MVP[^2]. But have you ever wondered how these are related and differ. Should you really bother to differentiate these. Actually you should, at least after my experience.  After successful completion of multiple MVPs and not sure what to do next, I finally discovered some other component or an important called USERS who eventually become CUSTOMER. Then landed on "Build what customer want ?" eventually you should be "Talking to User", "what to ask" , "how to ask" etc. But this amazing incubator ["This is a PROTOTYPE"](https://dschool.stanford.edu/shop/this-is-a-prototype) from d.school explained many questions and frustrations that I had and helps to germinate a seed of an idea and grow it to a Tree. The author [SCOTT WITTHOFT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/switthoft/) clarifies 
  - what is a prototype  and what is not a prototype .
  - What do you need to build one ?
  - How do you build one ?
  - How do you test ?
  - What do you get from this exercise.

## What is a prototype ?
&nbsp; &nbsp; A prototype is to learn, to explore and discover required features of a product. When you have assimilated all these requirements you have all the incredients to build the core product. It is shocking to know that while prototyping you should walk in opposite direction compare to  building a PRODUCT.

| Prototyping                                                             | Product building                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Prototyper                                                              | Craftsman                           |
| explore                                                                 | build                               |
| Careless                                                                | Careful                             |
| Doubts                                                                  | Walks with confident                |
| Not shy to build with what is available.                                | Builds with best material available |
| Sometimes deliberately choses coarser tool for LOW Resolution prototype | Perfection and best is the goal     |
| Fast                                                                    | Steady                              |
| Will break the work at end                                              | Iterates at the end                 |
| Artistic  and Right brained.                                            | Logical  and Left brained           |


## Author insists ?

&nbsp;&nbsp; SCOTT has done phenomenal job of break and rebuild mindset and attitude of a maker, builder or craftsman into a prototyper. A prototyper is crazy, experimental, strong mom to  her child, shameless to strip off his idea and expose to the world for testament, has to attachment to his idea and treats his conception as wet clay.

## Of course you should build what customer want
&nbsp;&nbsp; But how do you know what customer wants ? 
### iPhone 
imagine you are in 2006 and envisioning to build an iPhone. 
- Would you talk with an user ? no
- Would you prototype ? no. 
- What should you do ? Just build the iPhone.
### TESLA
imagine you are in 2004 and envisioning to build Tesla model 3. 
- Would you observe user ? Yes
Since you are not building the first electric car. Because Nissan successfully selling its NISSAN LEAF. So 


| How                         | Answer       |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| By talking with customer ?  | No           |
| By observing the customer ? | Sometimes    |
| By imagination ?            | Probably yes |

### Where Prototype is appropriate  ?
### Where would you talk to user  ?
### where would you observe user ?
### where would you train an  user ?




&nbsp; &nbsp; When I built my first MVP spent 95% of my time only on technical aspects and anxious when I was thinking about users or validating idea.
