### Semantic Kernel vs Prompt Flow

- As Semantic Kernel and PromptFlow are important libraries to build agents 
- As we (myself and my buddy ) are building [A personal finance app with Agents In-Built]({% link _posts/2025-10-02-how-to-design-an-app-with-agents.md %})
- I' pondering to understand where to use Semantic Kernel and where to use PromptFlow

| You want a visual flow/ DAG, modular nodes, team visibility                      | No              | Yes                                | PromptFlow to structure and visualize your Sk-based logic                                                  |
| heavy integration needed with existing code,libraries, APIs , business logic     | Yes             | No                                 | Use SK for heavy lifting but wrap or invoke parts via PromptFlow when you want orchestration at flow level |
| Simpler and linear prompt pipeline (eg: prompt-> model -> output -> postprocess) | No              | Yes                                | You may use SK funcitons/skills but flow is main driver                                                    |
| You anticipate the logic evolving, branching , growing more complex              | Yes             | No - Constrained for dynamic logic | Mix them : flows + planner nodes                                                                           |
