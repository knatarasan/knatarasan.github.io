### Semantic Kernel vs Prompt Flow

- As Semantic Kernel and PromptFlow are important libraries to build agents 
- As we (myself and my buddy ) are building [A personal finance app with Agents In-Built]({% link _posts/2025-10-02-how-to-design-an-app-with-agents.md %})
- I' pondering to understand where to use Semantic Kernel and where to use PromptFlow

| A Request that may require branching/dynamic decision making                      | Yes  (multiple plugins could be registered to SK, at runtime SK can decide which plugin to use) | No (static has limited control logic)                                           | You can embed SK logic inside a PromptFlow node to get dynamic behavior within a flow                      |

### Suggested prcatice
- Start with prompt flow for simple prompt pipelines; if behabior becomes more dynamic/complex, introduce SK for planning/skill orcgestration inside the flow
- Use Prompt Flow's evaluation/batch testing on SK planners&plugins to get metcis and guard quality
- Keep logic-heavy decisions down into SK and flow logic in prompt flow.
- Keep visualization and modular node capabilities in prompt flow to manage complexity, esp across team
