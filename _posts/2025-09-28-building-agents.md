  It is regular wednessday morning, I brought air fried chicken thighs to the table, it is still hot and fumes out of it. My son stared it and started eating by saying that seasoning has to be spread evenly. I said let me know the taste. After tasting the edge he said that It is good. I repeated you want the seasoning to spread, he noded. "I've noted it" I replied.

  Immediately I was wondering how my brian stores that information,
    - home cooking
      - which is healthy
      - Felt relieved (without cooking my son was surviving with his friends support.)
      - better economy choice
    - gratified to prepare breakfast my son

  I said that I'm storing this message with all these context like a vector DB, then Iniyan replied that vector DB might got inspiration from how human memory works.
