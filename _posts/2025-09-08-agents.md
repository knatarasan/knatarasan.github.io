### Book review : "Ai agents in action"
- The book is from an amazing author Micheal Lanham, from his background on  game coding he explain agentic concepts rationally with enough depth. with the first chapter he really sets a context gets a reader into the world of agents and make us to think through elements human mind mechanics.

#### Intro
  - How do you define an agent ? before defining he introduce an agentic concept that we have been using without the terminology of an agent.
    - Direct user interaction
    - Agent/assistant proxy
    - Agent/assistant
    - Autonomous agent
  - A brief intro on multi agent system
  - Components of an agent
    - Persona : (profile , how do you generate profile)
      - Actions and Tool use ( action targets, action space , action generation)
      - Memory and knowledge ( Retrieval structure , retrieval formats, retrieval operation)
      - Reasoning and Evaluation
      - Planning and Feedback ( planning without feedback , planning with feedback : environment, human, LLM and adaptive constructive feedback)
    - My Thought : This process makes me to feel like defining an agent is like defining a personality i.e, human personality ( typically it has a persona : a role with particular attitude , skills, which are gained, knowledge which are  gathered over a period, ability to process , plan and execute  )
    - Autonomous AI Mechanism 
    - AI Interface
      - For an initial look, AI interface may seem ambitious , but from this vision looking back conventional model seems primitive, since Convenventional User Interface is restricted, openiated expects the user to follow a strict workflow and very restricted on inputs it can take, what output it can show.
      
          <div class="mermaid">flowchart LR
            US[User] --> UI[User Interface] 
            UI--> BE[Back End]
          </div>

      - AI Interface will leverage following 
        - Conventional Informatin Assets
          - API
          - Data Store
        - AI assets
          - RAG mechanism
          - LLM models
          - Agentic Infrastructure 
      - With these it provides user an very interactable experience, thus users not restricted on inputs they provide, and what outputs that they can expect . [eg : They can quickly demand a report in a particular format, in the past for that they need to reach analytics department get approval pay for that department and get the report in 2 months time] 
#### Multi agent
  - I personally feel multi agent evolved over prompt engineering. Keeping multiple agents making them interactive, enhances a problem, which could be attacked from multiple perspective.
  - Autogen
    - microsoft built , good to work locally
  - Crew ai
    - has very good observability options, good fit for operationalizing.
    - role-based autonomous agents
    - Sequential  or Hierarchical task management

#### Agent Action
  - In the world of agents, Action composes skill plugin or even semantic kernal
  - <div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
    us[user] --> ra[Remote agent]
    ra -->|1 passes raw request| llm[LLM]
    llm --> |2 possible plugin to use and params|ra
    ra -->|3 params| pl[Plugin]
    subgraph plugin
      
      pl --> |4| eapi[External API]
      pl --> |5| llm
    end
    pl --> |6| ra
    ra --> us
    </div>

### A2A

 <div class="mermaid">
 flowchart LR
 us[user] --> ca[Client Agent]
 subgraph A2A 
  ca --> |1| a2a[a2a server]
  a2a --> |1.5
  
  | ra[Remote Agent]
  ra --> |2 Task Id: client agent can query status with this id anytime| a2a
  ra --> |3| ae[Agent Executor]
  ae --> |4| ra
 end
 
 </div>

### Agent memory
  <div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
  ri[Retrieval] --> rag[RAG]
  rag --> ss[Semantic Search and Document Indexing]
    subgraph langchain
      lc[LangChain] 
    end
  lc --> rag
  rag --> ak[Agent Knowledge]
  ak --> imp[Memory in agentic system]
  imp --> mkc[Memory and Knowledge compression]
  </div>
  
  - Knowledge vs Memory
    - Knowledge : An input with reasoning 
    - Memory : A plain input , abstract ( probably dealt with sub conscious )
      - Eg:
        - Music
        - A picture, an Icon
        - Haptic
  - Types of memory
    - Sensory memory
      - Iconic
      - Auditory
      - Haptic
    - Short Term
      - Conversational and context 
    - Long Term
      - 
### Prompt engineering
  - best practice on prompt engineering
### Agent Reasoning and Evolution
### Agent Planning and Feedback
