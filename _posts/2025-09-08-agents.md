### Book review : "Ai agents in action"
- The book is from an amazing author Micheal Lanham, from his background on  game coding he explain agentic concepts rationally with enough depth. with the first chapter he really sets a context gets a reader into the world of agents and make us to think through elements human mind mechanics.
  - How do you define an agent ? before defining he introduce an agentic concept that we have been using without the terminology of an agent.
    - Direct user interaction
    - Agent/assistant proxy
    - Agent/assistant
    - Autonomous agent
  - A brief intro on multi agent system
  - Components of an agent
    - Persona : (profile , how do you generate profile)
      - Actions and Tool use ( action targets, action space , action generation)
      - Memory and knowledge ( Retrieval structure , retrieval formats, retrieval operation)
      - Reasoning and Evaluation
      - Planning and Feedback ( planning without feedback , planning with feedback : environment, human, LLM and adaptive constructive feedback)
    - My Thought : This process makes me to feel like defining an agent is like defining a personality i.e, human personality ( typically it has a persona : a role with particular attitude , skills, which are gained, knowledge which are  gathered over a period, ability to process , plan and execute  )
    - Autonomous AI Mechanism 
    - AI interface
      - Its an amazing vision , which makes sense. From this perspective current model looks super primitive
